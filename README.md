=========================

Developed by [Fincluster](http://fincluster.com)

**Ownclud Mail Attachments** is an app for Owncloud (community edition) that allows users to create a mirror 
of all attachments from their email accounts (IMAP, POP3, GMail, ...) directly in their owncloud files directory.

A cron job constantly updates mirrors fetching new mail attachments.

This app is very useful for **private users, groups and business companies** where people makes a massive use of emails,
sending tons of attachments as primary way of file sharing with their contacts.

through Owncloud web access, desktop sync clients and mobile apps.
